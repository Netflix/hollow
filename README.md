Hollow is a java library and toolset for disseminating in-memory datasets from a single producer to many consumers for high performance read-only access. [Read more](http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/12/netflixoss-announcing-hollow.html).

Documentation is available at [http://hollow.how](http://hollow.how).  

## Getting Started

We recommend jumping into the [quick start guide](http://hollow.how/quick-start) â€” you'll have a demo up and running in minutes, and a fully production-scalable implementation of Hollow at your fingertips in about an hour.  From there, you can plug in your data model and it's off to the races.

## Get Hollow

Release binaries are available from Maven Central and jCenter.

|GroupID/Org|ArtifactID/Name|Latest Stable Version|
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
|com.netflix.hollow|hollow|5.1.3|

In a Maven `.pom` file:

        ...
        <dependency>
                <groupId>com.netflix.hollow</groupId>
                <artifactId>hollow</artifactId>
                <version>5.1.3</version>
        </dependency>
        ...

In a Gradle `build.gradle` file:

        ...
        compile 'com.netflix.hollow:hollow:5.1.3'
        ...
        
Release candidate binaries, matching the `-rc\.*` pattern for an artifact's version, are available from the jCenter [oss-candidate](https://dl.bintray.com/netflixoss/oss-candidate/) repository, which may be declared in a `build.gradle` file:

        ...
        repositories {
            maven {
                url 'https://dl.bintray.com/netflixoss/oss-candidate/'
            }
        }
        ...

## Get Support

Hollow is maintained by the Platform Data Technologies team at Netflix.  Support can be obtained directly from us or from fellow users through [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Netflix/hollow) or by opening an issue in this project.

## Generating the Docs

To view the docs locally you can just `make site-serve`, this will start the MkDocs server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
You can also run `make site-build` to build the site locally and `make site-deploy` to deploy it to Github.

MkDocs runs with python, the Makefile via the `venv` task should take care of setting the Python's _virtualenv_ for the site tasks.
It does assume that `virtualenv` is available as a command and it also assume that we are targeting _python3_.
Installing Python3 is out of the scope, check your OS package manager. For example, in Mac you can use [homebrew] to install `python3` or `anaconda3`.
