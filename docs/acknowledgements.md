Hollow is originally created by Drew Koszewnik with the advice and support of fellow members of the Data Platform Technologies team at Netflix:

* David Su
* Deva Jayaraman
* Jatin Shah
* Kinesh Satiya
* Lavanya Kanchanapalli
* Ramin Forood
* Rohit Kaul
* Tim Taylor

Hollow is maintained by the Data Platform Technologies team at Netflix.

Hollow makes use of an [implementation](https://github.com/yonik/java_util/blob/master/src/util/hash/MurmurHash3.java) of the MurmurHash3 algorithm authored by Yonik Seeley.

Hollow makes use of Thomas Wang's well known 32-bit mix function, which is based on an original suggestion by Robert Jenkins.

The _hollow-diff-ui_ object diff view was inspired in part by Chas Emerick's [jsdifflib](http://github.com/cemerick/jsdifflib), and borrows some of the .css from that project.

This documentation was created with [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org), using a theme from [material](https://github.com/Netflix/hollow).
