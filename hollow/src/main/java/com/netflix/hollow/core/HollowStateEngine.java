/**
 * 
 * A dataset changes over time.  A core concept in Hollow is that the timeline for a changing dataset can be broken
 * down into discrete "states", each of which is a complete snapshot of the data at a particular point in time.
 * 
 * A state engine holds a complete copy of a hollow dataset, and is generally the root handle to the data.  
 * The state engine can be transitioned between states.
 * 
 * Depending on whether a dataset is being produced or consumed, a HollowStateEngine will be either a {@link HollowWriteStateEngine} 
 * or a {@link HollowReadStateEngine}, respectively.
