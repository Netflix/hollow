/**
 * A MemoizedMap is a java.util.HashMap which is expected to be memoized during a producer cycle.
 * 
 * When a HollowObjectMapper adds a MemoizedMap to the HollowWriteStateEngine, it will tag it with the ordinal
 * which the corresponding record is assigned.  If the same MemoizedMap instance is encountered during the same cycle,
 * then it will short-circuit the process of serializing the map -- returning the previously memoized ordinal.
