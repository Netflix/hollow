 * 1) Tracking the latest announced data state version.
 * 2) Keeping the client up to date by calling triggerAsyncRefresh() on self when the latest version changes.
 * 
 * A default implementation {@link HollowAnnouncementWatcher.DefaultWatcher} is available.  If this implementation
 * is used, calling {@link HollowClient#triggerRefresh()} will always attempt to get to the latest state, unless an 
 * explicit state was specified via {@link HollowClient#triggerRefreshTo(long)}.

 * @deprecated Implement the {@link HollowConsumer.AnnouncementWatcher} for use with the {@link HollowConsumer} instead.
