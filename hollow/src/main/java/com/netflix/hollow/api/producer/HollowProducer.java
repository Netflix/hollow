/**
 * A HollowProducer is the top-level class used by producers of Hollow data to populate, publish, and announce data states.
 * The interactions between the "blob" store and announcement mechanism are defined by this class, and the implementations
 * of the data publishing and announcing are abstracted in interfaces which are provided to this class.
 * <p>
 * To obtain a HollowProducer, you should use a builder pattern, for example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *
 * HollowProducer producer = HollowProducer.withPublisher(publisher)
 *                                         .withAnnouncer(announcer)
 *                                         .build();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The following components are injectable, but only an implementation of the HollowProducer.Publisher is
 * required to be injected, all other components are optional. :
 *
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@link HollowProducer.Publisher}</dt>
 * <dd>Implementations of this class define how to publish blob data to the blob store.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>{@link HollowProducer.Announcer}</dt>
 * <dd>Implementations of this class define the announcement mechanism, which is used to track the version of the
 * currently announced state.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>One or more event listeners</dt>
 * <dd>Listeners are notified about the progress and status of producer cycles throughout the various cycle stages.
 * Of special note are {@link ValidatorListener} that allow for semantic validation of the data contained in
 * a state prior to announcement.  If a {@code RuntimeException} is thrown during validation, the state will not be
 * announced, and the producer will be automatically rolled back to the prior state.
 * </dd>
 *
 * <dt>A Blob staging directory</dt>
 * <dd>Before blobs are published, they must be written and inspected/validated.  A directory may be specified as a File to which
 * these "staged" blobs will be written prior to publish.  Staged blobs will be cleaned up automatically after publish.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>{@link HollowProducer.BlobCompressor}</dt>
 * <dd>Implementations of this class intercept blob input/output streams to allow for compression in the blob store.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>{@link HollowProducer.BlobStager}</dt>
 * <dd>Implementations will define how to stage blobs, if the default behavior of staging blobs on local disk is not desirable.
 * If a {@link BlobStager} is provided, then neither a blob staging directory or {@link BlobCompressor} should be provided.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>An Executor for publishing snapshots</dt>
 * <dd>When consumers start up, if the latest announced version does not have a snapshot, they can load an earlier snapshot
 * and follow deltas to get up-to-date.  A state can therefore be available and announced prior to the availability of
 * the snapshot.  If an Executor is supplied here, then it will be used to publish snapshots.  This can be useful if
 * snapshot publishing takes a long time -- subsequent cycles may proceed while snapshot uploads are still in progress.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Number of cycles between snapshots</dt>
 * <dd>Because snapshots are not necessary for a data state to be announced, they need not be published every cycle.
 * If this parameter is specified, then a snapshot will be produced only every (n+1)th cycle.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>{@link HollowProducer.VersionMinter}</dt>
 * <dd>Allows for a custom version identifier minting strategy.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Target max type shard size</dt>
 * <dd>Specify a target max type shard size.  Defaults to 16MB.  See http://hollow.how/advanced-topics/#type-sharding</dd>
 * </dl>
