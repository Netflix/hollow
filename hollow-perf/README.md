Run the `jmhJar` task to produce an uber-jar in the `build/libs` directory.

Then do 

- `java -jar build/libs/hollow-perf-*-jmh.jar -h` to print the help information
- `java -jar build/libs/hollow-perf-*-jmh.jar -l` to list the benchmarks

An alternative execution is to run the `jmh` task but that will run Gradle in addition to the benchmark which might 
introduce more variance in the results.

If the annotations declared on benchmark classes are modified it may be necessary to kill Gradle daemons and
rebuild.
